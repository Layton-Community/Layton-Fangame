# Layton Fangame

A Layton Fangame built with the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com).

## Getting started

Start by installing the Unity Hub if you don't have it yet: https://unity.com/download

Then, install the Unity Editor with the Unity Hub. Make sure to pick version **2021.3.1f1**.

If you don't have it yet, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine too.<br>
Or open the `Command Prompt` and type `winget install -e --id Git.Git` <br>
Make sure you have [Git LFS too](https://git-lfs.github.com/). If you used the Git installer on Windows, it's installed by default (same with winget).

Creating an ssh key is tricky for new users. So download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), link it to your github account, it will automatically ssh for you and serve as a git repository manager.

In the Unity Hub, switch the "Projects" tab, click "Add project from disk" and point to the repository where you cloned this repo.

You're now ready to open the project! Open it and have fun!

Useful Unity Resources:
* The [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html) is the reference document. It may require some familiarity with Unity to be fully understandable, but also includes some How-To pages.
* Unity has built [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/), which gathers some tutorials about Unity. You may find them a little too beginner-oriented though. If you are already familiar with programming, give it a quick look then switch to the manual which also has some How-To pages.
