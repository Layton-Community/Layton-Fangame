# Layton Fangame

A Layton Fangame built with the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com).

## Getting started

### Install Github Desktop

Creating an ssh key is tricky for new users. So download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), link it to your github account, it will automatically ssh for you and serve as a git repository manager.

### Download Unity Hub

Start by installing the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).<br>
Then, install the Unity Editor with the Unity Hub. Make sure to pick version **2021.3.1f1**.

### Install Visual Studio Community 2022

- You can choose any IDE, but for simplicity, we will install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- A window opens, named: Installation --- Visual Studio Community 2022
- Select `.NET desktop development` and `Game development with Unity`.
- Click on `Install`.

### Clone the repository

If you don't have access to the main repository, fork it, create a new branch, work on it and request a pull request.

In the Unity Hub, switch the "Projects" tab, click "Add project from disk" and point to the repository where you cloned this repository.

You're now ready to open the project! Open it and have fun!

Useful Unity Resources:
* The [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html) is the reference document. It may require some familiarity with Unity to be fully understandable, but also includes some How-To pages.
* Unity has built [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/), which gathers some tutorials about Unity. You may find them a little too beginner-oriented though. If you are already familiar with programming, give it a quick look then switch to the manual which also has some How-To pages.
